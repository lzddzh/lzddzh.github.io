Claasic Question.

## Description

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

## Complexity Analysis
O(n)

## Code

**My Code**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int i, j;
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i += j + 1) {
            int tank = 0;
            for (j = 0; j < gas.size(); j++) {
                tank += gas[(i + j) % gas.size()];
                tank -= cost[(i + j) % gas.size()];
                if (tank < 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (j == gas.size()) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```


**Perfect code**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int> &gas, vector<int> &cost) {

       int start = gas.size()-1;
       int end = 0;
       int sum = gas[start] - cost[start];
       while (start > end) {
          if (sum >= 0) {
             sum += gas[end] - cost[end];
             ++end;
          }
          else {
             --start;
             sum += gas[start] - cost[start];
          }
       }
       return sum >= 0 ? start : -1;
    }
};
```
	
## Useful code

```
// With out this, it will Excced time limit.
i += j + 1
```

Use pen and paper to run a few examples is quiet important to get the proper algorithm.

At first, I excced time, then I look for the discussion then find an optimization, i += j + 1.

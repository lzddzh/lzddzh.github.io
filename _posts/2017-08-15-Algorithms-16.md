An interesting method that reduces O(n^3) to O(n^2) in the 3 elements attampting in an array.

<!--more-->

## Description

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```
    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

## Complexity Analysis
O(n^2)

## Code

**My Code**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
            int s, l = i + 1, r = nums.size() - 1;
            while (l < r) {
                s = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];
                if (s == target) {
                    return target;
                } else if (s < target) {
                    if (abs(s - target) < abs(sum - target)) sum = s; 
                    l++;
                } else {
                    if (abs(s - target) < abs(sum - target)) sum = s; 
                    r--;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

## Proof

Why can we use one single while loop to go through the 2nd and the 3rd elements in the sum instead of going through all the possible combinations of them?

Or equivalently,

Why the O(n^2) method can replace the O(n^3) method with correctness?

```
----------------------------------------------------
^  ^                                               ^
|  |                                               |
|  +- second                                     third
+-first
```

Firstly, let's think about using the O(n^3) way to do this. If we don't compare the nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r], instead, we go through all the elements left in the array as the second pointer move forward each time, then it will cost O(n^3).

Then let's see our O(n^2) method, in this way we just try a subset of combinations of the second and third pointer. So which ones have been discarded? Obviously if (nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] < sum) then we will not consider the nums[l + 1] to nums[r - 1] as possible value of the third element but directly jump to the next iteration nums[l + 1] for the second value. These combinations have been discarded so we could reduce the O(n^3) to O(n^2).

Now think about why this is correct. The reason is straightforward, which is if (nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] < sum), then continue to try r - 1 will just lead us even far to the sum since the array is sorted and the previous elements will be smaller. So we can just don't try them.

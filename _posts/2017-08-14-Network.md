Build a reliable connection via unreliable connection

<!--more-->

## Background

1. The underlying layer is not reliable.
2. We need a reliable connection.

## Develop Our RDT

### no bit errors & no loss of packets
Suppose we have a perfect channel which has no bit errors and no loss of packets at all. Then the design of Rdt will be quite easy, since we just need to send and receive.

**Sender**:

1. Wait for a `rdt_send(data)` event.
2. Package the data to a `packet`.
3. Using `udt_send(packet)` to send.

**Receiver**:

1. Wait for a `rdt_rcv(packet)` event.
2. Extract the `packet` as `data`.
3. Deliver the `data`.

### bit error
In this situation, our underlying layer may flip bits in packet. In other words, we may receive a `packet`
